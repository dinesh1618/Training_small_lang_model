# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Language Tasks

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune the GPT-2 language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The process involves dataset preparation, model configuration, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets tqdm pandas
```

### Key Libraries
- `datasets`: For dataset management and preprocessing.
- `transformers`: For working with pre-trained models and tokenizers.
- `torch`: For model training and optimization.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `tqdm`: For progress visualization.

## Workflow

### 1. Dataset Loading

We use the Hugging Face `datasets` library to load and preprocess data. Example:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("dataset_name")
```

### 2. Preprocessing

Tokenization and input encoding are performed using the GPT-2 tokenizer:

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
encoded_data = dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x['text'], truncation=True, padding='max_length'))
```

### 3. Model Setup

Initialize the pre-trained GPT-2 model:

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
```

### 4. Training

Training is conducted using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)
loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = loss_fn(outputs.logits, batch['labels'])
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### 5. Evaluation

Evaluate the fine-tuned model on a test dataset:

```python
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    for batch in test_dataloader:
        outputs = model(**batch)
        # Compute metrics
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the provided `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.
3. Follow the notebook cells step by step to:
   - Load and preprocess your dataset.
   - Configure and fine-tune the model.
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model.

## Results

After fine-tuning, the model can perform language tasks with improved performance on the specific dataset.

## Notes

- Customize hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size in the training section to suit your dataset and hardware.
- Ensure sufficient GPU memory for training large models like GPT-2.
